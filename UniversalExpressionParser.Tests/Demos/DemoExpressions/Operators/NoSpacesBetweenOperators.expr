// The spaces between two ++ operators, and + was omitted intentionally to show that the parser will parse the expression 
// correctly even without the space.
// The expression below is similar to  println(((x1++)++)+x2). To avoid confusion, in some cases it is better to use braces.
println(x1+++++x2)
